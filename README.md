# 🎮 GameProjects

A wild collection of game-making experiments, prototypes & goodies: from head-kicking football to space-blast snakes to platformer mayhem.
*All written in C / Lua / C++ (and sometimes Python) because why not have fun in multiple languages?*

## 🚀 What’s in the box?

Here’s a quick tour of the folders you’ll find:

* **CSProjects** — classic computer-science games and smaller experiments. ([GitHub][1])
* **FootHeadBall** — yep, it’s as silly as it sounds: football + heads?! ([GitHub][1])
* **Platformer** — jump, run, dodge, repeat. ([GitHub][1])
* **Slither_in_Snake** — creepy, crawl-y … but fun. ([GitHub][1])
* **dinoclone** — because dinosaurs + games = awesome. ([GitHub][1])
* **intergalactic_game**, **space_shooter** — reach for the stars (and shoot them). ([GitHub][1])
* **ttt** — the timeless classic: Tic-Tac-Toe. ([GitHub][1])
* Plus other miscellaneous fun folders and bits. ([GitHub][1])

## 🧠 Why this project exists

* Because games are fun — and making them is even more fun.
* To learn different languages / engines / paradigms by doing *while* having fun.
* To build a sandbox of projects where I can experiment, break things, throw them away, and iterate.
* To share with others (hey — maybe you’ll find something cool here to fork or remix).

## 🎯 Highlights & Projects to Try

Here are some starter recommendations (and what you’ll find inside):

* **Space Shooter** – Fly your ship, dodge asteroids/enemies, rack up explosions.
* **Platformer** – Classic side-scroll, obstacles, maybe some secret levels.
* **Slither in Snake** – Snake game re-imagined (or at least my take on it).
* **DinoClone** – Dino themed game, charmingly rough around the edges but with heart.
* **FootHeadBall** – Head over heels for this one. Literally.
* And many more… dive in, pick your favourite, and start tinkering!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/refdiu/GameProjects.git  
   cd GameProjects  
   ```
2. Pick a folder/project.
3. Look for a README or instructions inside (some projects may be more polished than others).
4. Build & run: depending on the project it might require:

   * A C compiler (gcc/clang)
   * Lua interpreter
   * Maybe Python
   * Some assets (check the folder)
5. Have fun. Break it. Fix it. Remix it.

## 🤝 Contributing & Remixing

Absolutely! Want to contribute? Great.

* Feel free to fork the repo and submit PRs (bug fixes, improvements, new features).
* Want to make your own project inside here? Awesome — you’re welcome to add a new folder with your game experiment.
* Please include a little README inside your project folder explaining what it is, how to build/run it, and any credits.

---

## 📋 Roadmap / Next Ideas

* Clean up build instructions for each project.
* Add more asset-packs, maybe some sound effects & music.
* Try porting one of these to a web version (browser playable?).
* Create a “featured game” each month: pick one and polish it.
* More language experimentation (maybe Rust? Go? C# Unity?).
* Create a central launcher menu to pick & launch any project in the repo.
